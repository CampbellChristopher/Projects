This script runs on ACCT.OPER.STATS files and parses them into .csv files
This script requires python to be installed on your computer(A working python.exe)

Running the Program:
1. open up Windows cmd terminal

2. type the following two Strings as such: "String1 String2" with one space between and no quotation marks

3. String 1 is the location of your python.exe on your machine

4. String 2 is the location of this script

5. The next string is an example:

6. "C:\Software\Python\python.exe"  "C:/Users/ccampbell/PycharmProjects/OperatorActivityReport/OperatorActivityReport.py"



Troubleshooting:
1. The Strings must be in the correct format for the script to run

2. The script will take everything in the target directory and try to parse it, so there should only be appropriate files in the directory

3. Python.exe must be installed and in the target location for the script to run

4. Your input should be of the appropriate form
	Input Location should exist and look like this: X:\DataParse Solutions\ACCT.OPER.STATS\Input\
	Output Location should exist and look like this: X:\DataParse Solutions\output.csv

	Sample Input Selections:
	X:\Python Scripts\OperatorActivityReport\Input\
	X:\Python Scripts\OperatorActivityReport\Output.csv

5. Double check your have the appropriate \'s, such as after files for input location
